# HyperPress-Core

HyperPress-Core is the runtime Composer library behind HyperPress.

It contains:
- endpoint routing and template rendering (`/wp-html/v1/`)
- assets/runtime integration for HTMX, Alpine AJAX, and Datastar
- admin options and compatibility layers
- block integration and orchestration with HyperBlocks and HyperFields

## Package role

This package is a library, not a WordPress.org plugin entrypoint.

The WordPress plugin adapter lives in `src/app/plugins/api-for-htmx/` and loads this library from Composer.

## Installation

```bash
composer require estebanforge/hyperpress-core
```

If your project loads Composer autoload (`vendor/autoload.php`), HyperPress-Core bootstrap is loaded automatically via Composer `autoload.files`. If your host plugin uses a classmap-only autoloader that skips `autoload.files`, require the bootstrap chain explicitly on `plugins_loaded` — see [Installation — Vendoring inside a host plugin](docs/installation.md#vendoring-inside-a-host-plugin).

## Dependencies

- PHP >= 8.1
