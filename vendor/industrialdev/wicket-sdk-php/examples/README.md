# Examples

This folder contains examples for common use cases when working with the wicket sdk client.

All the examples can be run directly from the command line or browser.

Before getting started be sure to run composer install to fetch the latest SDK version

```bash
composer install
```

Then copy `settings.example.php` to `settings.php` and populate the placeholder values.
