# Wicket WordPress Base Plugin

## Style Notes
There is a placeholder theme.json file in the root of the plugin folder that is only there to provide an easy 'default styles' reference to Tailwind (WordPress should ignore it just fine), should we need to use fallback styles on a site that isn't running a Wicket theme. There is a similar fallback enqueue for Alpine in that scenario as well.
